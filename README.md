# ResumeGenerator

## DEMO

[Resume Generator Demo](https://marshal604.github.io/my-early-years-resume-generator/dist/#/resume/generator?path=sample.txt)

## Overview

Previously, I created resumes in Word, but adjusting the layout was troublesome. Therefore, I wanted to create my own customized resume. Currently, there is only one style, but I will add more templates in the future if I come across or think of nice ones.

Additionally, [CakeResume](https://www.cakeresume.com/dashboard) is already an excellent resume building website.

- Customizable resume
- Ability to upload files to update the resume
- Option to download files for future resume updates

- Supports printing resumes as PDF in Chrome

## 3rd-Party Libraries
